# Next.js App (app/ directory)

This directory follows the Next.js App Router conventions. Below are quick-start steps and helpful links for working with the app.

## Getting Started
Install dependencies (from the repository root):

```bash
# pnpm
pnpm install

# npm
npm install

# yarn
yarn install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
# pnpm
pnpm dev

# npm
npm run dev

# yarn
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app. Edits in the `app/` directory update the page via Fast Refresh.
